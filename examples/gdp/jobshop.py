#
# This model solves a jobshop scheduling, which has a set of jobs
# which must be processed in sequence of stages but not all jobs
# require all stages. A zero wait transfer policy is assumed between
# stages. To obtain a feasible solution it is necessary to eliminate
# all clashes between jobs. It requires that no two jobs be performed
# at any stage at any time. The objective is to minimize the makespan,
# the time to complete all jobs.
